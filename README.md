# OpenCV-and-YOLOv3

Hey! Thanks for checking out this repository. 

The code you will find here is based on this wonderful tutorial from learnopencv.com - https://www.learnopencv.com/deep-learning-based-object-detection-using-yolov3-with-opencv-python-c/

Here I'm trying to interpret the information that the awesome You Only Look Once (YOLO) neural net provides.

Hope you enjoy!
