# OpenCV-and-YOLOv3

Hey! Thanks for checking out this repository. 

Note: that in order to run this code, you'll need to go to to the official yolo website and download yolov3.weights and yolo.cfg (the model) from there and then specify the path to them in the code - https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/

The code you will find here is based on this wonderful tutorial from learnopencv.com - https://www.learnopencv.com/deep-learning-based-object-detection-using-yolov3-with-opencv-python-c/

Here I'm trying to interpret the information that the awesome You Only Look Once (YOLO) neural net provides.

Hope you enjoy!
